### Bio

![Badge](/images/badge.png "badge")

My name is Daniel Vadas and I am a programmer and cyber security enthusiast. I started learning programming when I was 14 by developing static sites and writing simple scripts. By the age of 16, I wrote my first CMS in PHP. Ever since then I have been learning, working on my skills, constaintly updating my existing knowledge and expanding my horizon.

I started working in the IT industry in 2011 as a system administrator for a medium sized company called Dominium-Ingatlan Kft. As I developed my web developer skills I got promoted to developer and I specializing on backend development. By the time I also started showing intrest to cyber security and penetration testing. 

A few years later in 2015 I started working for COPYGURU kft where I extended my knowledge even further on both fields by learning new languages (including Golang, Java and Python), using multiple web frameworks and libraries (Angular, Bootstrap, Gorilla mux, flask, etc) and taking parts in countless projects involving numerius technologies (mailing, file sharing, image manipulation, etc).
