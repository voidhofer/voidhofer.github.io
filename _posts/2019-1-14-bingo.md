## What is BinGO Site?
A simple but powerful web application written in golang.

This site is capable of serving multiple domains with different routing for each domain.
The program can run in both HTTP and HTTPS mode and it support multiple TLS keys for multiple domains.

## Get Started
Head over to [github](https://github.com/voidhofer/bingo-site)!

## Features
- Multi-domain support (with different routing rules for each domain)
- Multi-domain HTTPS support (using multiple tls configurations for domains)
- Template support
- Template plugin support (use existing plugins or write your own easily)
- MongoDB storage
- Fast and stable httprouter by Julien Smidth
- CSRF protection by Joseph Spurrier
- Google ReCaptcha support by Haisum
- Example templates built with Bootstrap (source included for local hosting)

## Warning!
Since this is a hobby project it is disencouraged to use it in production.
The software comes AS IT IS. There is no support for this software and there will not be no frequent updates, so it might get vulnerable/slow/deprecated as it gets outdated!
